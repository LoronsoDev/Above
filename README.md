# Above
Above Engine is a game engine for 2D games optimized for rendering big amounts of entities/sprites.

## Motivation
Above is a 3D engine built with a strong focus on architecture and optimization, particularly in rendering performance. Drawing on previous experience with both 3D and 2D engines, this project enhances the internal workings of a game engine, emphasizing efficient design patterns and application-wide performance improvements. The goal is to provide not only a powerful engine but also a user-friendly interface that clearly reflects the underlying processes, making complex engine functionality accessible and easy to understand for developers and users alike.

## How to build
1- Clone the project and update all its submodules (git clone --recurse-submodules or git submodule update --init --recursive after cloning)

2- Ensure you are on a Windows platform and run "scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat". This will build all the necessary files.

3- Open the Visual Studio project generated on the root folder.
