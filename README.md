# Above
Above Engine is a game engine for 2D games optimized for rendering big amounts of entities/sprites.

## Motivation
I have always been really interested in the "backend" of how game engines work. Previously, I worked on building other 3D engines (mainly to brush up my OpenGL) and 2D engines just so I could see the differences between both of them internally. With "Above" I wanted to give a deep focus to architecture, as well as optimization of the whole application, but specially it's rendering side. I also wanted to provide a nice and functional UX for the end user that reflects what's happening under the hood in a way that's easy to understand.

## How to build
1- Clone the project and update all its submodules (git clone --recurse-submodules or git submodule update --init --recursive after cloning)

2- Ensure you are on a Windows platform and run "scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat". This will build all the necessary files.

3- Open the vs project generated on the root folder.
