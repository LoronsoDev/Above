# Above
Above Engine is a game engine for 2D games optimized for rendering big amounts of entities/sprites.

## Motivation
Above is a 3D engine developed to tackle the challenges of balancing architecture and rendering optimization. After working with other 3D and 2D engines to refine my skills, I found they didn't fully address the need for both high performance and clear, accessible functionality. To solve this, I built Above with a focus on optimizing the rendering pipeline and overall architecture. Now, it offers a powerful engine with an intuitive user experience that allows developers to easily understand and interact with the underlying processes, making complex engine functions more accessible and efficient.

## How to build
1- Clone the project and update all its submodules (git clone --recurse-submodules or git submodule update --init --recursive after cloning)

2- Ensure you are on a Windows platform and run "scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat". This will build all the necessary files.

3- Open the Visual Studio project generated on the root folder.
